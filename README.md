# StarCatcher (Defold game engine)

This project was created from the "empty" project template using the Defold game engine within the Linux Ubuntu Server environment. 
The purpose of the game was to become familiar with the Defold game engine. Initial concept was established in part by Google Gemini 3.0 Pro.
Additional features and graphics enhancements were later added on with assistance from AI LLMs. Game is still work in progress. You can find
